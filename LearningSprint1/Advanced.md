## Day 1
### Topic: Fenwick Tree  
* It is a special data structure, usually represented using an "array". General Complexity, for Update & Query: O(log n), where n=Number of Elements of Array   
* It is also called "Binary Indexed Tree" (BIT) (because of the logic in its implementation and how it works).   
* General/Basic application problems, which require Fenwick Tree and can’t be solved using  Brute Force Approach:  
       1. Queries on Sum of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements  
       2. Queries on Product of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements, etc.

### Topic: Simple Segment Tree  
* It is a special data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively,  while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. 
* General Complexity, for Update & Query: O(log n), where n=Number of Elements of Array  - Many complex as well as simple problems can be solved using Segment Tree, efficiently.
* General/Basic application problems, which require Segment Tree and can’t be solved using  Brute Force Approach:      
     1. Queries on Sum of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements  
     2. Queries on Product of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements,etc.

***Fenwick Tree v/s Segment Tree***  
Nearly every problem that can be solved using Fenwick Tree can be solved using Segment Tree, but vice-versa isn’t true.  
But, since Fenwick Tree requires less memory as compared to Segment Tree, so, when the  "Memory Limit" for a problem is tight, try to solve the problem using Fenwick Tree. - Also, since Fenwick Tree is easier to implement, try, and use it over Segment Tree, where it is possible to use, to solve the problem.
