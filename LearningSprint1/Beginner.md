### Practice question based on two pointer technique:
1. https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
2. https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted
3. https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-triplets-with-zero-sum/1
4. https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Lots of problems that were given to you on Day1 and Day2 can be optimized using two pointer algorithm. Try to optimize your previous codes.
