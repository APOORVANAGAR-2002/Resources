# Day 1
### Topic: Binary Search :<br/>
Has to be completed on day 1. <br/>
Binary search is the most popular and most widely used search algorithm. It is efficient and also one of the most commonly used techniques that are used to solve varying problems. <br/>
It only works on a sorted set of elements. To use Binary Search, the set/collection of elements must be sorted. <br/>
**(Must Read)** Good Blog to Understand it better, with its basic implementation:<br/>
www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/binary-search/tutorial/ 
**(Must Watch)** A Youtube Video, for Better Understanding and Visualisation of Algorithm, to get  more grip:<br/> https://youtu.be/j5uXyPJ0Pew
<br/>Platforms to practice binary search: Leetcode, CodeChef, Hackerearth, Codeforces (Practice at least 4 questions.)<br/>

### Topic: Recursion  : <br/>
You have 4 days to complete the whole playlist and solve recursion related questions. 
Recursion generally means calling the function, inside the same function. <br>
We should have a Termination/Base Case because if there isn’t a base case, the process won’t terminate and the function will keep calling itself infinitely. 
**(Must Watch)** Youtube Video Series (Playlist) on the "How and Where exactly Recursion  works?":<br/> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeT1ffjiImo0sYTcnLzo-wY
### Questions:
Problem 1: <br/> https://www.codechef.com/CCCLS001/problems/TRICOIN 
``` Note: Try solving it using only Binary Search, even if you have another correct approach in your mind. You can try it using multiple approaches, but make sure that you do it once by "Binary Search" Approach ``` <br/>
Problem 2:<br/>  https://www.codechef.com/CCCLS001/problems/TRISQ 

``` Note: Just for practice, solve it using "Recursion" only ```

# DAY-2
### Practice Problem set 2 ('Intermediate' Track) 

**Suggestion**: Check out the Editorial of a Problem, only after trying and thinking upon the Problem, for at least 1.5 hrs. Also, if you aren’t able to solve it and you check out the editorial, please do try to follow and understand the editorial’s approach and try & submit a solution to the problem. Don’t leave the problem,  without making a submission. (These are suggestions, for practice.)
